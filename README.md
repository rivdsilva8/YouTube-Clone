# YouTube-Clone
# introduction
Welcome to my youtube-clone web app which uses the power of React and the youtube API  to make a simple React App using various React hooks and coding principles

# Features: 
* Implemented an advanced search allowing users to discover YouTube videos effortlessly.
* Advanced search parameters to facilitate precise and tailored search results for users.
* A seamless viewing experience by enabling users to watch YouTube videos directly on the
website interface.

# Running the Project: 
1. To run the YouTube Clone, you have to navigate to the YouTube-Clone folder using :

```bash
cd ./YouTube-Clone
```

2. After that you have to install the project's depenencies using :
```bash
npm i --force
```

3. Finally you can run the project using :
```bash
npm run dev 
```

4. by default the project will run on port 3000
you can see it in the browser using :

```bash
http://localhost:3000 
```

# Using the Project:
* To use the project, you can type whatever video you want to see into the Search Bar and you will get youtube videos based on your search.
* You can also use the advanced search feature by clicking the checkbox to expand that form and get access to filter according to Safe Search and Order by Relevaence, Data added, View Count etc.
* On clicking a video, you will be navigated to the video page and will be able to watch the video right in the application or navigate to youtube.com and watch it there.
* One issue on using the Youtbe API is some videos may be restricted to be played on websites outside the offical website, in which ase the link can be used to go there
